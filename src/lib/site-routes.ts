/**
 * SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for the site's indexable URL tree.
 *
 * Why this file exists: the Tyashin platform serves `/sitemap.xml` as a
 * sitemap-INDEX and has NO knowledge of this site's Next.js `app/` route tree,
 * so the code-defined pages were missing from the sitemap until the site
 * publishes its own. This module enumerates EVERY indexable page the site
 * actually serves so the sitemap and the built pages can never drift.
 *
 * The only consumer is `src/app/sitemap-pages.xml/route.ts`, which renders
 * every route below as XML. There are no enumerable `[slug]` routes to feed
 * back into `generateStaticParams` here (see EXCLUDED below), so this file
 * intentionally does NOT touch any route's `generateStaticParams`.
 *
 * EXCLUDED on purpose (not indexable / not code-enumerable — do not add here):
 *  - `/products` — a server redirect to `/collection`; not a real page.
 *  - `/products/[slug]` — e-commerce product DETAIL pages whose params come
 *    from the DB/API (`listProducts()`), not an in-repo list. They are not
 *    code-authoritative, so they stay out of this code sitemap.
 *  - `/blog/[slug]` — blog POSTS are platform-owned content and belong in the
 *    platform's own content sitemap (`/sitemap-content.xml`), NOT this page
 *    sitemap. `/blog` (the index) IS included.
 *  - utility routes (this sitemap route itself, robots.txt, etc.).
 *
 * Do NOT create `app/sitemap.ts` (path `/sitemap.xml`) — the platform owns
 * that path and index-references this one.
